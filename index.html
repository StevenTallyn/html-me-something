                    <p> While I find my life pretty boring and uneventful, cooking is something I have always been fond of.
                        I love exploring the different cuisines and cultures of the world, especially Mexican cuisine.
                        My passion for cooking started early in my life when I would help my grandmother cook for our family.  
                        My mother died when I was only 4 years old, so my grandmother would be at our house almost daily, cooking for my father, brother, sister and I.
                        In highschool, I took a cooking class in the home economics department and loved it!  I even landed multpile jobs in the restaurant industry at this time.
                        My first cooking job was at Noodles and Company.  While the work didn't pay that well, it was enjoyable!

                        After highschool, I attended the Missouri University of Mining and Technology (formerly UMR) in Rolla, MO.  Long story short, I ended up failing out and moving back to St. Louis with my parents.
                        Not wanting to give up, I set out to get a culinary arts degree from the Forest Park Community College. It was the first time in years where I enjoyed going to class, eventually getting my degree and a few friends along the way!
                        One of my favorite recipes I made for class was fire-roasted salsa, where I manipulated it to be fire-roasted salsa verde!  This is the recipe I created:
